### Portfolio 🤓

### Authentication form validator
In this project, I created an authentication form and I added validation using React Hook Form (useForm)

🔺 Use useForm and validations in real time.

🔺 Use Figma to create the form design, you can see the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/mGaqk4okkOibQ2DkULShYK/Auth-Form).

🔺 Other funtionalities as generate random password or hidden and show password.
