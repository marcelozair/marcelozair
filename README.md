## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a web full-stack developer, I've gained experience with various tools and technologies throughout my career. I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new things, constantly expanding my skill set. I like to take initiative within a team, striving to find the most suitable solutions to the challenges.

I like to talk about the solutions that I have helped to achieve as part of a team. One of the projects that I feel proud of is related to financial solutions, such as generating invoices, calculating the taxes to be paid, and making the process easier for users.

### Experience working with this tools:

Javascript (React, Angular, Vue, Next, Nuxt, NestJs, Express, TypeScript), Python (FastAPI, CloudFunctions) AWS, GCP, Postgresql, MySQL, Oracle MongoDB, Prisma, Docker, Pipelines, HTML, CSS (Tailwind, Bootstrap, Bulma, NextUI).
